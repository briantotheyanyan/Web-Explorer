Web Explorer
====
Web Explorer is a Chrome Extension that allows you to turn any web page into a platform video game. You can either clone the repo to test it out, or you can see a demo of it through a bookmarklet here:
http://www.brianyan.com/Web-Explorer
Just drag the Web Explorer button into your bookmarks, and from there, on many pages, all you have to do is click on the bookmark and it works.

Press W to Jump, A to move left, D to move right and S to fall through platforms.
