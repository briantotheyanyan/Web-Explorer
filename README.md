NSYZ
====

NYSZ is a javascript file that turns HTML files into platforms. All you have to do is import create.js into any html file and you it works. We also have an example using the Wikipedia Home Page, just open the HTML file in your browser (most tested in Chrome).

Press W to Jump, A to move left, D to move right and S to fall through platforms.

The Team and their current assingment:

Team Leader: Shan Shi

Brian Yan + Brian Zhang: Working on the physics engine for our hero, allowing him to jump, slide, attack and any other glorious movements
 
Eli Nass + Shan Shi: Working on creating an algorithim to read the HTML page and convert it into a level.

DEADLINES

4/5: Have a working physics engine and collison engine for our hero, as well as be able to read simple HTML files and convert them into levels. This is includes the main elements included on a page (<p>, <tb>, <input>) however, we won't start working on the more complex webpages that use Bootstrap until the following week.

4/12: Have an optimized physics engine with smooth movements and a hopefully animated character. Have more complex webpages be able to read, this might require screen scraping.

4/16: Working on the jumping of the character

4/21: Collision is working, still need to fully implement it. But the base of it works. However, the movement of the character is very clunky. Must find a way to make the motion more fluid.

4/27: Fixed the motion, have the stuff on screen almost working, just have to put the parts together. Almost have it working.

4/30: Got a VERY CLEAN and nice looking platforms for pages, and canvas that overlaps the page so it looks nice. Also began perfecting motion, still some kinks, but still very workable.
