NSYZ
====

NYSZ is a chrome plugin that allows for a new way to enjoy browsing the web, by turning any old web page into a 2D platformer level taken directly from the web page you were on. The level will be created from the actual web page itself, the platforms being anything from text on the page, a button, a table, or an image. But the fun doesn't stop there, just as you are able to click to transfer to another web page, NYSZ allows our NYSZ to use his switchboard-samurai sword to acsess links and transfer to that level.

The Team and their current assingment:

Team Leader: Shan Shi

Brian Yan + Brian Zhang: Working on the physics engine for our hero, allowing him to jump, slide, attack and any other glorious movements
 
Eli Nass + Shan Shi: Working on creating an algorithim to read the HTML page and convert it into a level.

DEADLINES

4/5: Have a working physics engine and collison engine for our hero, as well as be able to read simple HTML files and convert them into levels. This is includes the main elements included on a page (<p>, <tb>, <input>) however, we won't start working on the more complex webpages that use Bootstrap until the following week.

4/12: Have an optimized physics engine with smooth movements and a hopefully animated character. Have more complex webpages be able to read, this might require screen scraping.
